# Overview

Postcodes.io is a free, open-source postcode lookup API and geocoder for the United Kingdom maintained by [Ideal Postcodes](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk).

The API allows developers to:

- Look up detailed information about UK postcodes
- Reverse geocode coordinates to postcodes
- Search for postcodes by partial string
- Find nearest postcodes to a given location
- Access associated data like administrative areas and demographic information

No authentication is required to use this API.

## Data Accuracy & Limitations

### Coordinate Systems

The API provides coordinates in two distinct systems depending on the location:

- **Great Britain:** Grid references (`eastings`, `northings`) use the **British National Grid**.
- **Northern Ireland:** Grid references use the **Irish National Grid**.
- **Channel Islands & Isle of Man:** These records do not possess grid references. The `eastings`, `northings`, `latitude`, and `longitude` fields will be `null` or blank.

Latitude and longitude are derived from these grid references using specific transformations (`OSGB_1936_to_WGS_1984_Petroleum` for GB and `TM75_to_WGS_1984_2` for NI).

### Boundary "Straddling"

Postcodes are assigned to administrative areas (like Wards or Constituencies) based on a single "centroid" coordinate—the mean location of all addresses in that postcode.

- **Limitation:** If a postcode physically straddles a boundary (e.g., a street split between two councils), the entire postcode is assigned to the area where the centroid falls.
- **Impact:** This means addresses at the edge of a postcode may appear to be assigned to the "wrong" administrative area compared to their physical location.

### Pseudo Codes

In the `codes` object, you may encounter "pseudo codes" instead of standard GSS codes. These are used when a specific geography does not strictly apply to the region (e.g., Scotland does not use standard "County" definitions).

- **Format:** Typically `L99999999` (Channel Islands), `M99999999` (Isle of Man), `N99999999` (Northern Ireland), or `S99999999` (Scotland).
- **Recommendation:** Client logic should handle these specific codes as "Not Applicable" rather than treating them as valid IDs.

## Endpoint

All services can be accessed from the following subdomain:

```javascript
https://api.postcodes.io
```

The API accepts GET and POST requests. POST methods use content type `application/json`.

## Data Extraction

The Postcodes.io application and database are packaged as Docker images for rapid local deployment and data extraction.

To perform one-time data extraction tasks using SQL, see our [local data extraction guide](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/guides/postcodes-io-database).

## Error Handling

To check for errors, examine the HTTP response code. 200 response indicates success while any other code will provide important information about why an error occurred.

Alternatively, you can examine status code in the 'status' property in the result body.

## Versioning

The API currently does not use any form of versioning. Any changes to the API will be backwards-compatible, this includes: adding new properties to responses, adding new endpoints, adding new optional request parameters and changing the order of properties.

If we make backwards-incompatible changes in the future, this will be released under a versioned endpoint.
