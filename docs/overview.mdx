# Overview

Postcodes.io is a free postcode lookup API and geocoder for the United Kingdom.

## Endpoint

All services can be accessed from the following subdomain:

```javascript
https://api.postcodes.io
```

The API accepts GET and POST requests. POST methods use content type `application/json`.

## Data Extraction

The Postcodes.io application and database are packaged as Docker images for rapid local deployment and data extraction.

To perform one-time data extraction tasks using SQL, see our [local data extraction guide](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/guides/postcodes-io-database).

## Authentication

Postcodes.io does not require authentication.

## Error Handling

To check for errors, examine the HTTP response code. 200 response indicates success while any other code will provide important information about why an error occured.

Alternatively, you can examine status code in the 'status' property in the result body.

## Versioning

The API currently does not use any form of versioning. Any changes to the API will be backwards-compatible, this includes: adding new properties to responses, adding new endpoints, adding new optional request parameters and changing the order of properties.

If we make backwards-incompatible changes in the future, this will be released under a versioned endpoint.
