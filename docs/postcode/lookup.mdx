This endpoint allows you to retrieve detailed information about a UK postcode.

A successful request returns HTTP status code 200 and a JSON object containing comprehensive postcode data.

If the postcode is not found, the API returns a 404 response. If the postcode was previously active but has since been terminated, the error response will include a `terminated` property with details about the terminated postcode.

For more details, see the [API Documentation](/docs/api/lookup-postcode)

## Terminated Postcode Response

If a postcode is not found but exists in the terminated postcodes dataset (i.e., it was previously a valid postcode but has since been deactivated), the 404 response will include a `terminated` property:

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Postcode not found",
  "terminated": {
    "postcode": "AB1 0AA",
    "year_terminated": 1996,
    "month_terminated": 6,
    "longitude": -2.242851,
    "latitude": 57.101474
  }
}
```

If the postcode is not found and was never a valid postcode (i.e., not in the terminated dataset), the response will not include the `terminated` property:

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Postcode not found"
}
```
