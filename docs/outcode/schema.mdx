The Outcode schema represents geographical and administrative information associated with a UK outward code (the first part of a postcode). This data is returned when using the outcode lookup endpoints.

## Example

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "result": {
    "outcode": "SW1A",
    "longitude": -0.13226037062937065,
    "latitude": 51.504530636363654,
    "northings": 180053,
    "eastings": 529727,
    "admin_district": [
      "Westminster",
      "Wandsworth"
    ],
    "parish": [
      "Wandsworth, unparished area",
      "Westminster, unparished area"
    ],
    "admin_county": [],
    "admin_ward": [
      "Nine Elms",
      "St James's"
    ],
    "country": [
      "England"
