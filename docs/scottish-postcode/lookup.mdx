This endpoint allows you to retrieve Scottish Parliamentary Constituency data associated with a Scottish postcode.

A successful request returns HTTP status code 200 and a JSON object containing Scottish postcode data.

If the postcode is not found in the Scottish Postcode Directory (SPD), the API returns a 404 response. For postcodes that exist in the ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD) but not in SPD, a 404 response is returned with the message "Postcode exists in ONSPD but not in SPD".
