Postcodes.io can be installed using two Docker containers: the postcodes.io application container and the postcodes.io database container.

### Requirements

- Local copy of [postcodes.io repository](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Quickstart

If you want to launch the postcodes.io HTTP interface and underlying database quickly, you may do so with `docker-compose`.

Clone the project repository and run docker-compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Running the above command in your terminal will create and network the containers. The HTTP service will be available on port `8000`.

### Application Container

The Postcodes.io application, which provides the HTTP interface, is packaged as a Docker container identified on the Docker Hub as `idealpostcodes/postcodes.io`.

Example usage:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8000 idealpostcodes/postcodes.io
```

Configuration available via Environment Variables:

- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE`
- `POSTGRES_HOST`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`
- `PORT (HTTP Port to run on)`

### Database Container

`idealpostcodes/postcodes.io.db` points to a [PostgreSQL & PostGIS](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdillon/postgis/) base image and preloads the latest `pg_dump` in the initialization process. The database Docker image is updated with new releases of the ONSPD dataset.

The database Docker image is updated with new releases of the ONSPD dataset. See the [Changelog](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for when a new dataset has been ingested.

:::info
Upon starting a container for the first time, PostGIS will be enabled and the `pg_dump` will take 15-60s to restore depending on your system resources.
:::

Example Usage:

```bash
$ docker run -p 5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postcodesio -e POSTGRES_DB=postcodesiodb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password idealpostcodes/postcodes.io.db
```

As this contains the official PostreSQL base image, the available configuration environment variables are documented [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
