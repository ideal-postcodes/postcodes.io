					h2#Overview.doc-header Overview

					h4 Postcodes.io is a free Postcode lookup API and geocoder for the UK

					h3#Endpoint Endpoint

					p All services can be accessed from the following HTTP[S] endpoint

					pre
						h4 https://api.postcodes.io

					p The API accepts GET and POST requests. POST methods use content type <code>application/json</code>

					h3#Responses Responses
					p JSON(P) only. CORS is enabled.

					p Each response comes with an appropriate HTTP Status code (except for JSONP requests). These include 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 404 for not found and 500 for server error. The HTTP Status code is also included in the response body.

					h3#Authentication Authentication

					p Postcodes.io does not require any authentication.

					h3#Error-Handling Error Handling

					p To check for errors, examine the HTTP response code. 200 response indicates success while any other code will provide important information about why an error occured.

					p Alternatively, you can examine status code in the 'status' property in the result body.

					p All JSONP requests return 200 responses because of silent errors. When using JSONP, be sure to use the latter method to check for errors.

					h3#JSONP JSONP

					p JSONP requests are supported. Simply appended the URI with a callback name. E.g.

					pre
						h4 https://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/GU50BD?callback=foo

					h3#Versioning Versioning

					p The API currently does not use any form of versioning. Any changes to the API will be backwards-compatible, this includes: adding new properties to responses, adding new endpoints, adding new optional request parameters and changing the order of properties.

					p If we make backwards-incompatible changes in the future, this will be released under a versioned endpoint.

					h3#Data Available Data Fields

					h4 Postcode Data (Ordnance Survey Postcode Directory Dataset)

					p Data returned by the <code>/postcodes</code> and <code>/outcodes</code> API

					p <b>Note:</b> Some fields may be <code>null</code> if not applicable or populated. These fields return type is specified as <code>type|null</code>

					h2#Install-notes.doc-header Install Notes

					p There may be occasions where you want to host postcodes.io yourself. We've laid out instructions below on how to do this.

					p Installing Postcodes.io is matter of cloning the source. For example,

					pre
						h4 $ git clone https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io.git

					p We currently provide 3 methods to import the necessaru datasets

					ol
						li The easiest is to use our install script. This will require postgres superuser privileges to create and provision your database. It will then download the database and import the data from a pg_dump (hosted and created by us).
						li You can download the pg_dump and attempt to import the database yourself with psql or pg_restore.
						li Lastly, you can retrieve the raw CSV data from the ONS and import it with our import script.

					h3#install-requirements Requirements

					ul
						li
							a(href="http://nodejs.org") Node.js
						li
							a(href="http://postgis.net/install/") Postgresql and Postgis

					h3#data-download Data Download

					p Data is sourced and can be downloaded from the
						a(href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page") Office for National Statistics Data Portal.
						| The dataset is often not easy to find. The simplest way is to search for "Postcode Directory".

					p Alternatively you can download a
						a(href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/app-pgdump.html") pg_dump
						| of the postcode database which is hosted by us. This is the same dump which is used by the install script. The link to the latest dump can be found in our
						a(href="https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io/blob/master/latest") repository.

					h3#install-script Install Script

					p Currently the install process targets *nix systems. We've provisioned and tested on OS X Mavericks &amp; Ubuntu 14.04. Please
						a(href="/about") let us know
						|  if you have issues on other operating systems.

					p Postcodes.io is packaged with a
						a(href="https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io/blob/master/bin/setup.sh") script
						| to provision postgres and download a dump (pg_dump) of the ONS Postcode Directory (hosted by us). The script will do the following,
					ul
						li Prompt you for your postgres superuser credentials (most of the setup steps require this level of privilege)
						li Create a new user "postcodesio"
						li Create a new database "postcodesiodb" owned by "postcodesio"
						li Create the necessary extensions on "postcodesiodb"
						li Download, unzip and stream the Postcode directory into Postgres

					p To run,

					pre
						h4 $ npm run setup

					h3#import-from-pgdump Manual Installation from our pg_dump

					p To setup the database from our pg_dump simply download, gunzip and use either psql or pg_restore to import the data into Postgresql.

					p For example,

					pre
						h4 $ cat postcodeiodb.sql | psql postcodesiodb

					h3#import-from-ons Manual Installation

					p The install scripts can be linked to your shell (or can be found in the <code>bin/</code> directory). To link, navigate to <code>postcodes.io/</code> and run <code>$ npm link</code>

					h4 ONS Postcode Directory

					p Download the latest Office for National Statistic's "Postcode Lookup Dataset". Unzip the data locally. Run the import script <code>$ onsImport</code> passing the path to the CSV data.

					pre
						h4 $ onsImport /path/to/data/ONSPD/Data/data.csv

					h4 OS Open Names

					p Download the latest Ordnance Survey Open Names dataset. Unzip the data locally. Run the import script <code>$ osPlaceImport</code> passing the path that contains the CSV data files.

					pre
						h4 $ osPlaceImport /path/to/data/opname_csv_gb/Data/

					h3#update-script Data Updates

					p If you wish to manually update your data or data schema, we provide a script which will do this for you with minimal downtime (currently ~10-20 seconds to generate smaller relations).

					h4 ONS Postcode Directory

					p Download the latest Office for National Statistic's "Postcode Lookup Dataset" and run the import script <code>$ onsUpdate</code> passing the path to the CSV data.

					pre
						h4 $ onsUpdate /path/to/data/ONSPD/Data/data.csv

					h4 OS Open Names
