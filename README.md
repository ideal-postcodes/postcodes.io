# Postcodes.io [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/goingdotin/postcodes.io/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/goingdotin/postcodes.io?branch=master)

Query for UK postcodes and geolocations over HTTP. Postcodes.io uses the Office for National Statistics Postcode Directory.

Documentation can be found at [postcodes.io](http://postcodes.io)

## Requirements

Please make sure you have the following available:

- Node.js v6.x [(Instructions)](http://nodejs.org/)
- Postgres (9.5 or greater)
- PostGIS extension [(Instructions)](http://postgis.net/install)

We also have an end-to-end guide to install Postcodes.io on a fresh virtual machine [in the wiki](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io/wiki/Installing-Postcodes.io).

## Install & Download Data & Run

**Download and install**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/postcodes.io.git

$ cd postcodes.io/ && npm install
```

**Configure Postgres and Seed Database**

Postcodes.io is packaged with a script to setup and download the ONS Postcode Directory. To run this, navigate into the repository directory and run,

```
$ npm run setup
```

This script will prompt you for Postgres superuser credentials. This privilege is required to create a new user, database, extensions and then to load the data. For the security conscious, you can find out how this works by [reading our installation notes](http://postcodes.io/docs#Install-notes) and [the script itself](/bin/setup.sh). Other install methods are available but require a bit of extra work.

You can change the Postgres username/password yourself but you will need to update 'config/config.js' with the relevant credentials.

The import process takes around 10 minutes to complete.

**Run it**

```
node server.js // Default environment is development
```

### Running with Docker

Postcodes.io is packaged as a Docker container identified on the Docker Hub as `idealpostcodes/postcodes.io`.

```
docker run -d -p 8000 idealpostcodes/postcodes.io
```

Configuration available via Environment Variables:

- `MAPBOX_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_DATABASE`
- `POSTGRES_HOST`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`


## Testing

```
$ npm run setup_test_db # create test database

$ npm test
```
