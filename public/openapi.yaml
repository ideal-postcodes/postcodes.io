    # Overview


    Postcodes.io is a free postcode lookup API and geocoder for the UK


    ## Endpoint

    All services can be accessed from the following HTTP[S] endpoint


    `https://api.postcodes.io`

    The API accepts GET and POST requests. POST methods use content type
    application/json


    ## Responses

    JSON(P) only. CORS is enabled.


    Each response comes with an appropriate HTTP Status code (except for JSONP
    requests). These include 200 for success, 400 for a bad request, 404 for not
    found and 500 for server error. The HTTP Status code is also included in the
    response body.


    ## Authentication

    Postcodes.io does not require any authentication.


    ## Versioning

    The API currently does not use any form of versioning. Any changes to the
    API will be backwards-compatible, this includes: adding new properties to
    responses, adding new endpoints, adding new optional request parameters and
    changing the order of properties.


    If we make backwards-incompatible changes in the future, this will be
    released under a versioned endpoint.

            The national LAU1-equivalent code for each postcode. Pseudo codes
            are included for Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The field will
            otherwise be blank for postcodes with no grid reference.


            As of May 2021. NUTS has changed to International Territorial Levels
            (ITL). Postcodes.io will report ITL in nuts and codes.nuts to
            preserve backwards compatibility.


            Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, a new UK-managed
            international statistical geography - ITL (International Territorial
            Levels) - was introduced from 1st January 2021, replacing the former
            NUTS classification. They align with international standards,
            enabling comparability both over time and internationally. To ensure
            continued alignment, the ITLs mirror the NUTS system. They also
            follow a similar review timetable, every three years.


            NUTS is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides
            a breakdown of the European Union's territory for producing regional
            statistics that are comparable across the Union.


            The ITL area classification in the UK comprises current national
            administrative and electoral areas, except in Scotland where some
            ITL areas comprise whole and/or part Local Enterprise Regions.


            The ONSPD contains the LAU1 code (9-character LAD/UA code for
            England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 'S30' code for Scotland). A
            comprehensive lookup of LAU and ITL codes is included with the
            accompanying metadata.
