      The national LAU1-equivalent code for each postcode. Pseudo codes are included for Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The field will otherwise be blank for postcodes with no grid reference.

      As of May 2021. NUTS has changed to International Territorial Levels (ITL). Postcodes.io will report ITL in nuts and codes.nuts to preserve backwards compatibility.

      Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, a new UK-managed international statistical geography - ITL (International Territorial Levels) - was introduced from 1st January 2021, replacing the former NUTS classification. They align with international standards, enabling comparability both over time and internationally. To ensure continued alignment, the ITLs mirror the NUTS system. They also follow a similar review timetable, every three years.

      NUTS is a hierarchical classification of spatial units that provides a breakdown of the European Union's territory for producing regional statistics that are comparable across the Union.

      The ITL area classification in the UK comprises current national administrative and electoral areas, except in Scotland where some ITL areas comprise whole and/or part Local Enterprise Regions.

      The ONSPD contains the LAU1 code (9-character LAD/UA code for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 'S30' code for Scotland). A comprehensive lookup of LAU and ITL codes is included with the accompanying metadata.
    example: "Westminster"
